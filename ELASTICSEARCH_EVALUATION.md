- **Ingestion time**: 82.80 seconds
- **Throughput**: 5,117.7 embeddings/second
- **Average per PDF**: 1.03 seconds
- **Speedup vs Postgres**: **3.7x faster** (Elasticsearch: 83s vs Postgres: 305s)

**Note**: Elasticsearch's bulk API with `async_bulk` helper provides excellent ingestion performance, similar to Redis but more reliable.

### Query Latency (Single User)

#### Cold Cache (first queries after restart)
| k   | p50      | p95      | p99      | Success |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 5   | 1,158 ms | 2,171 ms | 3,036 ms | 20/20   |
| 10  | 1,142 ms | 1,216 ms | 1,271 ms | 20/20   |
| 20  | 1,150 ms | 1,165 ms | 1,167 ms | 20/20   |

#### Warm Cache (repeated queries)
| k   | p50      | p95      | p99      | Success |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 5   | 1,152 ms | 1,178 ms | 1,188 ms | 20/20   |
| 10  | 1,161 ms | 1,585 ms | 1,941 ms | 20/20   |
| 20  | 1,153 ms | 1,166 ms | 1,167 ms | 20/20   |

**Important Note**: ~1,100-1,150ms of query time is ColPali embedding generation (CPU-bound).
Actual Elasticsearch kNN search is estimated **<50ms** - extremely fast for 423K vectors.

**Consistency**: Elasticsearch shows very stable latency across all test rounds with minimal variance, unlike Redis which had cold start spikes.

### Concurrent Load Performance

| Users | Total Queries | Success | Time     | QPS  | p50       | p95       | p99       |
|-------|---------------|---------|----------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2     | 20            | 20/20   | 23.97s   | 0.83 | 2,234 ms  | 2,275 ms  | 2,277 ms  |
| 5     | 50            | 50/50   | 57.43s   | 0.87 | 5,537 ms  | 5,677 ms  | 5,688 ms  |
| 10    | 100           | **100/100** | 114.34s  | 0.87 | 11,163 ms | 11,350 ms | 11,392 ms |

**✅ Excellent Reliability**: **100% success rate** at all concurrency levels. No connection timeouts or failures even under heavy load.

**Observations**:
- Perfect reliability across all concurrency levels
- Latency scales linearly with concurrent users (expected behavior)
- Throughput remains stable (~0.87 QPS) regardless of user count
- Much better than Redis (55% success at 10 users)
- On par with Postgres (100% success) but with faster ingestion

### Memory Usage

**During sequential queries (20 queries)**:
- **Peak RAM**: 13.40 GB (85.4% of 16GB limit)
- **Mean RAM**: 13.30 GB (84.8%)
- **Delta**: +181 MB during query workload

**Under concurrent load (5 users)**:
- **Peak RAM**: 13.63 GB (86.9%)
- **Mean RAM**: 13.44 GB (85.7%)
- **Delta**: +372 MB

**Memory breakdown**:
- ColPali model: ~11.9 GB
- Elasticsearch (JVM + data): ~1.5-1.7 GB
- Application overhead: ~0.2 GB

**Note**: Elasticsearch's memory usage is comparable to other databases. The JVM heap is configured for 512MB-2GB, with actual usage staying within reasonable bounds.

### Storage Footprint

| Elasticsearch volume   | 1.1 GB  | Index data + metadata                    |
| Embeddings cache       | 207 MB  | Raw numpy files (baseline)               |
| HuggingFace cache      | 11.93 GB| ColPali model + dependencies             |
| Backend Docker image   | 1.2 GB  | Python + FastAPI + dependencies          |
| **Index overhead**     | **0.89 GB** | Beyond raw embeddings (5.3x multiplier) |

**Comparison**:
- Postgres: 1.58 GB (6.3x overhead)
- Qdrant: 360 MB (1.66x overhead) ← best
- Redis: 1.45 GB (5.7x overhead)
- **Elasticsearch: 1.1 GB (5.3x overhead)** ← middle ground

**Startup time**: Elasticsearch starts quickly (~5 seconds). Index loads automatically on startup with no noticeable delay.

## Elasticsearch-Specific Features

### Hybrid Search (Vector + Full-Text)

One of Elasticsearch's killer features is combining vector similarity with traditional search:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "knn": {
            "field": "vector",
            "query_vector": [...],
            "k": 10
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "cable knit"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "term": {
            "difficulty": "beginner"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This enables queries like:
- "Find patterns visually similar to this image AND mentioned in text"
- "Search by vector similarity BUT filter by metadata (difficulty, yarn weight)"
- "Combine semantic search with exact keyword matching"

**Note**: We didn't implement this in our testing (kept interface generic), but it's a significant advantage over purpose-built vector DBs like Qdrant.

### Aggregations + Vectors

Elasticsearch can aggregate results while performing vector search:

```json
{
  "knn": {...},
  "aggs": {
    "difficulty_breakdown": {
      "terms": {"field": "difficulty"}
    },
    "avg_similarity_score": {
      "avg": {"field": "_score"}
    }
  }
}
```

Example: "Find similar sweater patterns, grouped by difficulty level with average similarity scores"

### Use Case: Multi-Modal Content Platform

Imagine a recipe/craft pattern site:

```
User Query: "easy cable knit scarf"
                ↓
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Elasticsearch Hybrid Query               │
│ • Vector: embedding("easy cable scarf")  │
│ • Text: match(title, "cable knit")       │
│ • Filter: difficulty = "beginner"        │
│ • Agg: group by yarn weight              │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↓
Results:
1. Cable Knit Scarf (beginner)
2. Simple Cables Scarf (beginner)
3. First Cable Project (beginner)

Facets:
- Worsted weight: 12 results
- Bulky weight: 5 results
- Fingering: 1 result
```

You get vector similarity, keyword matching, metadata filtering, AND analytics in one query.

## Developer Experience

### Setup Time
- **Docker service**: 5 minutes (single-node config)
- **Index creation**: 10 minutes (clean JSON mapping)
- **Adapter implementation**: 2.5 hours (bulk API, kNN queries, deduplication)
- **Full ingestion**: 1.5 minutes
- **Testing & verification**: 1 hour
- **Total**: ~4 hours from zero to functional

### Pain Points
- **JVM heap sizing**: Had to configure ES_JAVA_OPTS for heap min/max (not intuitive for Python developers)
- **Dense vector indexing**: Needed to understand `index: true` vs `index: false` for vectors (indexed = searchable but slower ingestion)
- **kNN query syntax**: Initially confusing - `knn` field at query root, not inside `query` object
- **Deduplication logic**: Like Redis, had to implement pdf_id deduplication manually
- **Dependency management**: Needed to add both `elasticsearch` and `aiohttp` packages

### Pleasant Surprises
- **async_bulk helper**: Made bulk inserts trivial - just pass list of actions
- **Error messages**: Clear, actionable error messages when things went wrong
- **Index introspection**: Easy to verify mappings and settings via REST API (`curl http://localhost:9200/patterns/_mapping`)
- **Zero configuration changes**: Default settings worked perfectly for our use case
- **No connection tuning**: Unlike Redis, no timeout or connection pool issues

### Documentation Quality
- **Official docs**: Excellent - comprehensive, with examples
- **kNN search guide**: Clear documentation for dense_vector field type and kNN queries
- **Python client**: Well-documented async support, bulk helpers
- **Community resources**: Abundant Stack Overflow answers and blog posts
- **Migration guides**: Easy to find upgrade/migration docs

## Evaluation Metrics

### Practicality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Would I use this again?** Yes, especially for hybrid search use cases.

Elasticsearch's **100% reliability** and **stable performance** make it production-ready. The ability to combine vector search with full-text, filtering, and aggregations is a massive advantage for real-world applications.

**Best for**:
- Applications needing both semantic (vector) and keyword (full-text) search
- Teams already using Elasticsearch for traditional search
- Use cases requiring metadata filtering alongside vector similarity
- Production systems requiring high availability and operational maturity
- Medium to large datasets (100K-10M+ vectors) with decent infrastructure
- Projects with hybrid queries: "find similar items that match X criteria"

**Not ideal for**:
- Vector-only workloads (Qdrant is faster and more storage-efficient)
- Resource-constrained environments (JVM adds ~500MB overhead)
- Projects without Elasticsearch expertise (steeper learning curve than Postgres)
- Cost-sensitive projects (higher resource usage than Qdrant)
- Maximum performance scenarios (Qdrant is 4.5x faster ingestion)

**Rating explanation**: Dropped from 5/5 to 4/5 because while Elasticsearch is excellent, Qdrant is purpose-built for vectors and outperforms it significantly. However, Elasticsearch's hybrid search capabilities justify the 4-star rating.

### Learnings: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Unique insights gained**:

1. **Hybrid search power**: Combining vectors + text + filters + aggregations in one query is incredibly powerful
2. **Operational maturity matters**: Elasticsearch's production-ready features (monitoring, clustering) matter more than raw speed
3. **Reliability over speed**: 100% success rate beats faster ingestion with failures
4. **JVM not a dealbreaker**: Expected JVM to be painful, but it was fine with proper heap sizing
5. **Bulk API excellence**: `async_bulk` helper is best-in-class for bulk operations
6. **Dense vector indexing**: `index: true` enables kNN search but adds storage/compute overhead (worth it)

**Would have learned more with**: Implementing actual hybrid queries (vector + text) to fully leverage Elasticsearch's strengths.

### Fun: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**How enjoyable was this?**

Very enjoyable. The Python client API is elegant, errors were clear, and seeing 100% success rate across all tests was satisfying. No frustrating debugging sessions like Redis. The hybrid search potential is exciting.

**Highlight**: Zero failures across all 100 concurrent queries. Rock-solid.

**Lowlight**: Had to manually implement pdf_id deduplication (not a big deal, but would be nice to have built-in).

## Final Thoughts

Elasticsearch is a **solid, production-ready choice** for vector search, especially when you need hybrid search capabilities (vectors + text + filters). The **100% success rate** under load and **stable performance** inspire confidence.

However, if you're doing **pure vector search**, **Qdrant** is the better choice:
- 4.5x faster ingestion
- 3x smaller storage footprint
- Purpose-built for vectors

But if you need:
- Vector search + full-text search in one query
- Metadata filtering and aggregations alongside similarity
- Operational maturity (monitoring, clustering, backups)
- Existing Elasticsearch infrastructure

Then **Elasticsearch is the right choice**.

**Recommendation**:
- **Pure vector search?** → Use Qdrant
- **Hybrid search (vectors + text + filters)?** → Use Elasticsearch
- **Limited resources?** → Use Postgres
- **Caching layer?** → Use Redis (with a primary DB)

Elasticsearch sits in the sweet spot between general-purpose (Postgres) and specialized (Qdrant), offering the best of both worlds for hybrid search workloads.
